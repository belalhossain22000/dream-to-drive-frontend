# Dream 2 Drive

## Overview

Dream Drive serves as a facilitator for transactions between buyers and sellers
of performance and sports cars. Operating on a commission-based system, we offer
both "buy now" and auction options to cater to different buyer preferences.
Dream Drive does not own any cars; instead, it provides a platform for sellers
to list their vehicles and connect them with interested buyers.

## Key Features

1. **Auction and Buy Now Options**:

   - **Auction Lots**: Sellers can list their vehicles in auction lots where
     buyers can place bids.
   - **Buy Now Option**: Buyers can submit a 'buy now price.' If this price is
     within 20% of the reserve price, the seller will be notified.

2. **Commission-Based System**:

   - Upon the sale of an auction lot, Dream Drive takes a 5% fee from the
     buyer's credit card based on the sold price.

3. **User-Friendly Website**:

   - The website has a clean, professional design that is easy to navigate and
     accessible.
   - It is optimized for high traffic and performance.

4. **Essential Functionalities**:
   - **Registration and Login Features**: Secure user accounts with integrated
     payment gateways.
   - **Search and Filtering Options**: Enable users to find specific vehicles
     quickly and easily.
   - **Notifications**: Email and SMS notifications for bids, auctions ending
     soon, and other important events.
   - **Security Measures**: Use HTTPS, implement data encryption, and protect
     against common vulnerabilities to ensure the safety of customer details,
     including credit cards, home addresses, mobile numbers, and emails.

## Branding

- **Logo**: A logo needs to be created for Dream Drive.
- **Brand Colors**: Suggestions for brand colors are welcome to align with the
  company's vision and target audience.

## Goals

- Create a platform that is user-friendly, professional, and secure.
- Facilitate seamless transactions between buyers and sellers of performance and
  sports cars.
- Ensure the website can handle high traffic and provide an excellent user
  experience.

## Additional Considerations

- **Minimizing Costs**: If there are existing websites with similar services
  that you would like to replicate, please share them. Cloning such websites can
  help minimize costs and streamline the development process.

## Feedback and Improvements

- **Open to Ideas**: Any suggestions to improve this project are welcome as I am
  new to this and learning on the go.

discuss how we can make Dream Drive a success!
