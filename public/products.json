    "description": "<h2>KEY FACTS</h2>\n<p>This 992-generation Porsche 911 Dakar is an acclaimed all-terrain performance car, finished in the evocative ‘Roughroads’ colour scheme. It is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre flat-six, delivering 480PS and 570Nm of torque to all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shift. The odometer shows just 46 kilometres from new.</p>\n<p>Please note: this is a VAT-qualifying / tax-deductible vehicle for those who are able to reclaim it. This means that the ‘hammer price’ includes VAT, and the winning bidder will be provided with a VAT invoice.</p>\n<p>For Spanish buyers: an additional 16% would be due on top of the hammer price to register the vehicle.</p>\n\n<h2>EQUIPMENT AND FEATURES</h2>\n<p>As standard, the 992 Dakar features a raft of technology including Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus), Porsche Traction Management, Sport Chrono Package with Dakar-specific engine mounts and ‘Offroad’ and ‘Rallye’ modes, Power Steering Plus, Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC), and rear-axle steering. The front and rear bumpers both feature stainless-steel protection guards, and the car also features a lightweight carbon-fibre bonnet, a fixed CFRP rear spoiler, an Exclusive Design fuel filler cap, and black wheel arch mouldings. This example is finished in the ‘Roughroads’ livery as a nod to the original ‘Rothmans’-sponsored cars, and features a metallic blue lower section and a white upper section complete with gold and red bands. The cabin is trimmed in black leather and Race-Tex, punctuated by blue stitching and embroidered headrests. It rides on a set of white 19-inch front and 20-inch rear five-spoke alloy wheels, fitted with Pirelli Scorpion All-Terrain tyres. Equipment includes parking assistance with cameras, carbon-fibre bucket seats, a half roll cage, suspension lift, cruise control, dual-zone climate control, Porsche Communication Management (PCM) with satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto, and a roof rack with integrated LED lights, jerry cans, and traction boards. Accompanying the sale is the memento box including numbered plaque and limited-edition watch, fire extinguisher, warning triangle, gloves, straps, and two keys.</p>\n\n<h2>Specification:</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>High-gloss black brake callipers</li>\n    <li>Air purification ioniser</li>\n    <li>Lightweight construction and noise protection glazing (including privacy glass)</li>\n    <li>Leather steering column</li>\n    <li>Bi-colour Rallye Design Package</li>\n    <li>Rally package with fire extinguisher</li>\n    <li>Smoker’s package</li>\n    <li>Race-Tex sunshades</li>\n    <li>Burmester surround-sound system</li>\n    <li>Vehicle Tracking System Plus</li>\n    <li>Coloured rev counter</li>\n    <li>Roof rack with LED auxiliary lights and complete set of accessories (water canisters, folding shovels, and traction boards)</li>\n    <li>Dakar watch</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>CONDITION</h2>\n<p>Please refer to the photo gallery to assess exterior and interior condition.</p>\n\n<h2>SUMMARY</h2>\n<p>The 992-generation Porsche 911 Dakar was released in celebration of the 1984 Paris Dakar-conquering 911 Carrera, and features a raft of upgrades including raised suspension and a new driving mode.

It rides on a set of white 19-inch front and 20-inch rear five-spoke alloy wheels, fitted with Pirelli Scorpion All-Terrain tyres. Equipment includes parking assistance with cameras, carbon-fibre bucket seats, a half roll cage, suspension lift, cruise control, dual-zone climate control, Porsche Communication Management (PCM) with satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto, and a roof rack with integrated LED lights, jerry cans, and traction boards.

    "description": "<h2>KEY FACTS</h2>\n<p>This 992-generation Porsche 911 Dakar is an acclaimed all-terrain performance car, finished in the evocative ‘Roughroads’ colour scheme. It is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre flat-six, delivering 480PS and 570Nm of torque to all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shift. The odometer shows just 46 kilometres from new.</p>\n<p>Please note: this is a VAT-qualifying / tax-deductible vehicle for those who are able to reclaim it. This means that the ‘hammer price’ includes VAT, and the winning bidder will be provided with a VAT invoice.</p>\n<p>For Spanish buyers: an additional 16% would be due on top of the hammer price to register the vehicle.</p>\n\n<h2>EQUIPMENT AND FEATURES</h2>\n<p>As standard, the 992 Dakar features a raft of technology including Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus), Porsche Traction Management, Sport Chrono Package with Dakar-specific engine mounts and ‘Offroad’ and ‘Rallye’ modes, Power Steering Plus, Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC), and rear-axle steering. The front and rear bumpers both feature stainless-steel protection guards, and the car also features a lightweight carbon-fibre bonnet, a fixed CFRP rear spoiler, an Exclusive Design fuel filler cap, and black wheel arch mouldings. This example is finished in the ‘Roughroads’ livery as a nod to the original ‘Rothmans’-sponsored cars, and features a metallic blue lower section and a white upper section complete with gold and red bands.
